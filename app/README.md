## How it works?

Navigate through the side menu and click what are you looking for:

-Realm status: display information about the status of the US realms.

-Search character: search a characters by name in all realms or in a particular one.

-Search guild: search guilds by name in all realms or in a particular one.

-PVP Leaderboards: display the top 10 leaderboards in all brackets (2v2 and 5v5 are not available at the moment because of Battle.net API problems).
